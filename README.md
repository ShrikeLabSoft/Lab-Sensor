# Lab-Sensor
Simple lab sensor implemented using Iot

# Hardware Used

A Raspberry Pi Zero was used for this project. A [Dissolved Oxygen Sensor](https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/do_kit.html) from Atlas Scientific was used to detect oxygen levels. The time of the samples and the oxygen level was saved in a .csv file.

Two LEDs were used alongside the sensor as indicators of how many samples have been taken. A simple pull-down switch was used to start and stop taking samples.

# Software Used

A LAMP [Linux Apache Mysql PHP] (https://www.atlas-scientific.com/product_pages/kits/do_kit.html) environment was set up for the raspberry pi running as a server. the webpage has a basic download link for the file
